# Epicodus Volunteer Tracker

This application allows a user to track projects and the volunteers working on them. Each volunteer will belong to only one project, a one(project) to many(volunteers) relationship. The user will be able to view, add, update and delete both projects and volunteers.

### Installing

Installation is quick and easy!
First clone the repository, navigate to the repository and open in your text editor(I used Atom.) In your terminal window, run '$ bundle install'
Make sure you have Postgres installed(the above command '$ bundle install' should take care of this for you') and run a Postgres server in a terminal window, by entering '$ postgres' in the command line.
In a seprate terminal window navigate to the file path, and use Sinatra run 'app.rb' by typing '$ruby app.rb'. If you chose to clone the repository, after you run 'app.rb' you will need to copy the localhost path into your web browser. The standard localhost for Sinatra is port 4567.

###Data Base Setup

In yet another terminal window, type in '$ psql' to run our SQL and follow the instructions to set up the project databases.

In PSQL:
First check if extension for uuid is available
SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions;
To install that UUID-related extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
next is SQL, set up databases as follows.
CREATE DATABASE volunteer_tracker;
\c volunteer_tracker
CREATE TABLE volunteers (id uuid PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR, project_id uuid);
CREATE TABLE projects (id uuid PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR, description VARCHAR);
for testing/running rspec:
CREATE DATABASE volunteer_tracker_test WITH TEMPLATE volunteer_tracker;

and enjoy!
